We worked on two different clips, one was supposed to be played before the actual movie in theaters and the other was purely made for advertisement. Anima provided the animatic for the movie theater scene and allowed our class to come up with the idea for the promotional clip, letting us then work on the storyboard and animatic. We worked with the same rigs and models that were used in making the movie.

### Theather

I worked on this shot from start to finish, minus the phone constraint and some minor tweaks due to me getting ill. This was one of the longest and most complicated shots in the clip for having all three characters move a lot at the same time. This was also the first time I animated these characters, which brought the difficulty level higher, as the rigs weren’t that familiar to me yet - we had only made some tests on them before the actual work. In the end I liked how the shot turned out and even received some compliments from the storyboard artist from Anima.

### Goofing around

Another quite challenging shot due to Morphy (the orange character) rolling around vigorously. I was given a file with rough keyframes but had to redo them a lot to be able to use the rigs’ features better, and in the end it most likely saved a lot of time and tears. Morphy’s rolling was indeed a challenge, requiring a lot of frame to frame animation, but in the end I was again quite happy with it. I received no improvement ideas or negative feedback on this shot from Anima’s side, which was a personal win for me, as some parts of the animation gave me a hard time.

I only worked on polishing this shot. After sending the final animations Anima still wanted some tweaks on this one, and I took on the job to fix those issues and then additionally polish it even further. The shot had been challenging for the people who worked on it previously, as it had changed its “owner” multiple times and we ran out of time to put it to the same level with the other shots in the clip. However, I’m happy with what I achieved in one day only, making it look much better in my eyes. This was then approved by Anima’s team.

### What I've learned

This project taught me a ton of new things: animating with complex, industry standard rigs and general animation principles, which I knew beforehand but could now put to actual use.

- Animating with complex, industry standard rigs: The rigs had a lot of detail put into them, and while I didn’t end up using all of the features, they definitely had a lot of quality-of-life -improvements compared to the ones us students produce at school and also to some good rigs you can find online. This part made me realize how important it is to know the rig before you start animating, as I also had to take some steps back during the first shot, make adjustments and even animate using different controllers than I did at first to make the process smoother and the animation look better.

- Animation principles and storytelling: While animation principles are technically not new to me and I’ve animated before, this project had a larger scale than anything I’ve ever worked on previously and I really had to put some thought into it. Trying to capture weight and realistic movement more than ever before did hone my skills and made me look deeper into how to do that.

- Project pipelines: While feedback loops and project pipelines were familiar to me after working on multiple other school projects, it was definitely a good experience to go through it all with a well established animation studio. We had our own share of tech issues and it made me realize just how important good communication is.

Learning to not get stuck: If I could go back I would definitely tweak some things in the shots and polish them further. I’m something akin to a perfectionist and it’s hard for me to let go and put out something that could use fixing, even if those would be minor things. However, learning not to get stuck and do your best with the time you’ve given was something I simply had to accept and it was a prevalent theme in our whole class during the project.

### Conclusion

In general this was a very fun project to work on and I’m beyond happy that my school and teachers made it possible. It also changed my view on animating for video movies or shows, as I had previously thought I only enjoyed making animation cycles for games - working on these shots turned out to be fun and I found myself very invested in making them! If I had to mention something negative about this all, it would be that I would’ve liked more feedback on my work from the professionals, as I simply see it as a chance to improve even further. A little bit of mixed feelings on this one, because while I am happy that my shots passed without bigger problems, I’d have liked a more seasoned animator to give comments to me
